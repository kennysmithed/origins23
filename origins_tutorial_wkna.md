title: Week 10 tutorial briefing
description: Language evolution and self-domestication 
---

For the final tutorial you will read and discuss [Thomas & Kirby (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-018-9612-8). This article (which is essentially a précis of [James Thomas's PhD thesis](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12267)) provides a nice summary of a couple of ideas that have been central to this course, namely that a bunch of interesting features of language are a product of cultural evolution, and that understanding the evolution of the capacities underpinning cultural transmission is therefore a central question in language evolution. The paper also presents the argument that the precursor traits they identify can be understood as products of self-domestication. I have suggested some issues you could consider when you are reading it and discussing it in your groups, but don’t feel constrained by these - this is a nice paper to finish up on because it touches on nearly all the topics we have covered on the course, so you can make the discussion as wide-ranging as you like.

## Possible points to consider

- What do they think the key "precursor traits" for cultural evolution are? Do you agree with their list?
- What lessons do they take from Bengalese finches and domesticated dogs specifically? What do Siberian foxes add to the argument? What changes if [the interpretation of the fox domestication experiment changes](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russian-foxes-tameness-domestication)? 
- What is the relationship between self-domestication and (cultural) niche construction - are they the same thing, or are there important differences? What do they imply about ongoing evolution in humans for language-related capacities?
- Do you buy the Thomas & Kirby argument regarding self-domestication? What are the convincing points? What are the weaknesses? Haver you seen any competing theories to explain the same set of observations?
