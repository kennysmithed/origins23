title: Week 6 tutorial briefing
description: Inferring language from non-linguistic artifacts
---

In this week's lecture and associated readings we have been looking at human evolution, with the aim of understanding the ecology that shaped the evolution of our species, but also in the hope that we might be able to glean some clues about when language evolved. Unfortunately, writing is a very recent invention, and spoken languages don’t leave direct traces in the archaeological record. However, it might be possible to make inferences about when language evolved, or whether some hominid population had language, if we can infer the presence of language from something that does show up in the archaeological record – tools, beads, ochre etc.

The question for this week’s tutorial is therefore: can we infer the presence (or absence) of language from the presence (or absence) of certain types of material culture in the archeological record? The set readings take opposing positions on this question. Henshilwood & Dubreuil (2009) argue that these kind of inferences can be made; Botha (2010) provides a very skeptical response. The Blombos cave in South Africa features quite prominently in both papers, so you might want to check out [the wikipedia page on that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blombos_Cave). Make sure you have read *at least one* of the papers.
